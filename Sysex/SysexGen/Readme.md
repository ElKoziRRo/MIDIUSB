# SysexGen
The SysexGen is a small command line utility to create binary content of the SysEx message for changing cable name. The usage of the utility is the folowing: SysexGen filename.syx "Cable Name". Where 'filename' is the name of the SysEx file and 'Cable Name' if the new name to display in MIDI applications. 

The created needs to be sent to the USB-MIDI cable (e.g. using MidiOx) for changing the name.
